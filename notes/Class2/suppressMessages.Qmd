# [`suppressMessages()`]{.blue}
 
 
### [suppressMessages]{.blue}(*function*){.center} 
 
# What it does 

+ This will muffle messages produced by a chatty function.  
  
  
 
# Demo code 

```{r eval=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(h2o))
```
  
 
# Usefull stuff 

+ It may be clearer to write: [`library(*package*, quietly = TRUE)`]{.blue}.
+ This helps with packages that are chatty even when using the `quietly = TRUE` argument to [`library()`]{.blue}.
+ This prevents many messages from showing up in R Markdown output without suppressing other critical messages.
