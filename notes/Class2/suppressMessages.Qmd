# Function name: suppressMessages
# Notes:
#.blue[`suppressMessages()`]
.center[.blue[`suppressMessages`]`(*function*)`]
+ This will muffle messages produced by a chatty function.  
  
```{r eval=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(h2o))
```
+ It may be clearer to write: .blue[`library(*package*, quietly = TRUE)`].
+ This helps with packages that are chatty even when using the `quietly = TRUE` argument to .blue[`library()`].
+ This prevents many messages from showing up in R Markdown output without suppressing other critical messages.
