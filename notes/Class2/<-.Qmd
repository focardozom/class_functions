# [`<-`]{.blue}
 
 
### [*thingy* <- *something*]{.blue}{.center} 
 
# What it does 

+ You use [`<-`]{.blue} to assign an object (e.g., *thingy*) a value (e.g., *something*).
+ The [`<-`]{.blue} operator is pronounced "gets".
+ In other languages this would be an `=`.
  
 
# Demo code 

```{r eval=FALSE}
everything <- 42
```
  
 
# Usefull stuff 

+ You can also use  [`->`]{.blue} (e.g., *`something`* [`->`]{.blue} *`thingy`*) but it violates all style guides.
  
 
# Common Problems 

+ Use an [`=`]{.blue}, not [`<-`]{.blue} , to assign values to an argument in a function call.
