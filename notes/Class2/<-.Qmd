# Function name: <-
# Notes:
# .blue[`<-`]
.center[.blue[`*thingy* <- *something*`]]
+ You use .blue[`<-`] to assign an object (e.g., *thingy*) a value (e.g., *something*).
+ The .blue[`<-`] operator is pronounced "gets."
+ In other languages this would be an `=`.
```{r eval=FALSE}
everything <- 42
```
+ Use an .blue[`=`], not .blue[`<-`] , to assign values to an argument in a function call.
+ You can also use  .blue[`->`] (e.g., *`something`* .blue[`->`] *`thingy`*) but it violates all style guides.
