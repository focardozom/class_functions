# Function name: <-
# Notes:
# [`<-`]
[[`*thingy* <- *something*`]]
+ You use [`<-`] to assign an object (e.g., *thingy*) a value (e.g., *something*).
+ The [`<-`] operator is pronounced "gets."
+ In other languages this would be an `=`.
```{r eval=FALSE}
everything <- 42
```
+ Use an [`=`], not [`<-`] , to assign values to an argument in a function call.
+ You can also use  [`->`] (e.g., *`something`* [`->`] *`thingy`*) but it violates all style guides.
