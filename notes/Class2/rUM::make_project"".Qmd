### [make_project]{.blue}("*location*"){.center} 
 
# What it does 

+ This copies the "shell" for an academic paper into a folder/directory.
+ For example, this copies the rUM files into the current folder:
  
 
# Demo code 

```{r eval=FALSE}
rUM::make_project("./")
```
  
 
# Usefull stuff 

+ It is probably easier to use the New Project Wizard from the File menu and choose Research Project Template.
