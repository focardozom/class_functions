# [`slice_sample()`]{.blue} grabs a few records.
If you have a lot of data, you can easily use [`slice_sample()`]{.blue} with the [`n =`]{.blue} or [`prop =`]{.blue} arguments to take a sample for doing preliminary work.  Be sure to use the base R [`set.seed()`]{.blue} function before [`slice_sample()`]{.blue} to specify which set of random records to select.
```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
laryngectomy %>%
  select(age, gender, recur_site, trt_mod, int_stg, recur_stg) %>%
  slice_sample(prop = .05)  # a random 5% of the data
```
