# [New Pipe `|>`]{.blue}
 
 
### *thing* [|>]{.blue} *thing*{.center} 
 
# What it does 

+ The base R pipe, [`|>`]{.blue}, is designed to pass an object into the first argument of another function. 
  
 
# Demo code 

```{r eval=FALSE}
mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> head()
```
  
 
# Usefull stuff 

+ This pipe is faster than the magrittr pipe (i.e., [`%>%`]{.blue}).
+ It can not redirect to any argument other than the first.
+ It is of limited use because many critical functions (e.g., [`lm()`]{.blue} and [`plot()`]{.blue}) do not take a dataset as the first argument.
