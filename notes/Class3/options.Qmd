# Notes for: options()
# [`options()`]
.small[
[[`options`]`(*option* = *value*)`]
]
+ The [`options()`] function sets the global behavior used by R, including how numbers are printed/formatted.  
+ Some packages allow you to set default behavior.
  + For example, you can turn off messages about how [`summarise()`] function behaves in [`dplyr`] with this option:
```{r}
options(dplyr.summarise.inform=FALSE)
```
