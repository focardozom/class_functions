## The Library Function 

The library function is used in R to load packages from installed libraries into the active R session. It helps to prevent a user from needing to type multiple lines of code for a single package. This can be useful for saving time when loading multiple packages into the active R session.  

### What Package Does It Contain? 

The library function contains packages found in the default libraries of R and user-installed packages. Packages can be specified as either a full name or partial names if the user cannot remember the full name.
