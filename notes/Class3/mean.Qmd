# Notes for: mean()
# [`mean()`]
[[`mean`]`(*vector*, na.rm = *value*)`]
+ It calculates an average. 
+ By default it returns `NA` is any value is missing.
+ You normally use this on a typical numeric variable but it can be use for other types of data if it can convert them to numbers (like dates/times). 
  + You can also calculate the average on a logical (TRUE/FALSE) variable to get the percent true.  <mark>Remember</mark>: 1=TRUE/YES, 0=FALSE/NO in everything you do.
