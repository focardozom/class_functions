# [`dplyr::select()`]{.blue} 
.center[[`select`]{.blue}`(*dataset*, *variables*)`]
+ Use [`select()`]{.blue} to choose variables to keep in a new dataset.
```{r eval = FALSE}
laryngectomy %>%
  `select(age, gender, death_fu)`
complications <- laryngectomy %>%
   select(complications`:`comp_2plus)
```
+ [`select()`]{.blue} does not do autocomplete.
+ You can refer to variables by position number. The first variable is 1. `r emo::ji("nauseated_face")`.
 + You can .red[remove/exclude] unwanted variables with a `-`:
```{r eval = FALSE}
withoutComplicationVars <- laryngectomy %>%
   select(`-`(complications:comp_2plus))
```
