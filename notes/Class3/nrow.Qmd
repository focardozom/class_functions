# Notes for: nrow()
# [`nrow()`]
[[`nrow`]`(*dataset*)`]
+ [`nrow()`] reports the number of rows/records in a dataset (or matrix).
```{r}
nrow(mtcars)
```
+ You will likely use this with [`scales::comma()`] to include the number of observations in a dataset as part of a report.
```{r}
scales::comma(
  nrow(medicaldata::covid_testing)
)
```
