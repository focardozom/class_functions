# Function name: pull
# Notes:
# .blue[`pull()`] makes a vector.
.center[.blue[`pull`]`(tableName, variableName)`]
Rarely, you will want to pull a column out of a data frame and save it as a vector. .blue[`pull()`] is the only `dplyr`o verb that does not return a tibble.
```{r eval = FALSE}
yes_no_ND <- laryngectomy %>%
  mutate(hadND = 2 - nk_dissection) %>% 
  pull(hadND)
```
