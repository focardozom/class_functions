[[`group_by`]`(tableName, groupingVariable)`]
Before dplyr 1.1 to get groups you would tag the dataset as having a grouping variable:
```{r eval = FALSE}
laryngectomy %>%
  select(gender, length_fu) %>% 
  `group_by(gender)` # marks the grouping variable
```
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
laryngectomy %>%
  select(gender, length_fu) %>% 
  group_by(gender) # marks the grouping variable
```
