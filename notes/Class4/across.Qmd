# Notes for: across()
# [`dplyr::across()`] with [`dplyr::mutate()`] 
[[`across`]`(varaibles), function`]
+ The [`across()`] function with [`mutate()`] does the same mutation to multiple variables.
```{r eval=FALSE}
laryngectomy %>% 
  # Convert categorical character variavbles to be factors.
  mutate(
    across(gender:sor, factor)
  ) 
```
+ The [`across()`] function is used with [`dplyr::summarise`] to apply the same summary statistics to many variables.
