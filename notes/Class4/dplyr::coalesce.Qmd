# Function name: dplyr::coalesce
# Notes:
# .blue[`dplyr::coalesce()`]
.center[.blue[`coalesce`]`(varaible(s))`]
+ The .blue[`coalesce()`] function chooses the first not-missing value from a set of variables.
```{r eval=FALSE}
laryngectomy %>% 
  # Get day of worst outcome: death, reoccurrence, visit, or huge negative number
  mutate(
    outcome_day = coalesce(death_fu, recur_fu, length_fu, -99999999)
  ) 
```
+ If you include a huge outlier as the last option, it will make it easy to spot missing values.
