[[`case_when`] (`*check* ~ *response*, ..., *check* ~ *repsonse*`)]
+ [`case_when`] does a series of logic checks, in the order listed, and assigns the response from the first check that is true.

+ [`case_when()`] often uses `TRUE` as the last logic check.  Because it is always true, it acts like "else" or "otherwise". 
+ Use [`case_when()`] instead of [`if_else()`] if there is *any* chance the data has unexpected values.
