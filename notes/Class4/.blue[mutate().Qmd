# Notes for: .blue[mutate()
# [dplyr::mutate()] for Errors and Secret Codes
```{r}
analysis <- balise %>% 
  mutate(middle = if_else(middle == "x", NA_character_, middle)) %>% 
  mutate(births = if_else(births < 0, NA_real_, births))
analysis
```
Notice the print method for black and white puts NA inside of <>.  I prefer the print method used in the console.
