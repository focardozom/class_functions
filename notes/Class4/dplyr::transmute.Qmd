# [`dplyr::transmute()`]{.blue}
 
 
### 
laryngectomy %>%
  transmute(hadND = 2 - nk_dissection {.center} 
 
# What it does 

[`transmute()`]{.blue} is like [`dplyr::mutate()`]{.blue} but it only keeps the variables referenced.  Because it is picking what variables to keep, you can select other variables without manipulating them.
