# [`dplyr::pull()`]{.blue} makes a vector.
.center[[`pull`]{.blue}`(tableName, variableName)`]
Rarely, you will want to pull a column out of a data frame and save it as a vector. [`pull()`]{.blue} is the only `dplyr` verb that does not return a tibble.
```{r eval = FALSE}
yes_no_ND <- laryngectomy %>%
  mutate(hadND = 2 - nk_dissection) %>%
  pull(hadND)
```
