# [`dplyr::pull()`]{.blue} makes a vector.
 
 
### [pull]{.blue}(tableName, variableName){.center} 
 
# What it does 

Rarely, you will want to pull a column out of a data frame and save it as a vector. [`pull()`]{.blue} is the only `dplyr` verb that does not return a tibble.
  
 
# Demo code 

```{r eval = FALSE}
yes_no_ND <- laryngectomy %>%
  mutate(hadND = 2 - nk_dissection) %>%
  pull(hadND)
```
