# Notes for: transmute()
# [`transmute()`] only keeps the mutation.
This is just way too much typing:
```{r eval = FALSE}
laryngectomy %>%
   select(nk_dissection)  %>%
   mutate(hadND = 2 - nk_dissection)
```
Instead, just transmute. It will drop all the other variables:
```{r eval = FALSE}
laryngectomy %>%
  `transmute(hadND = 2 - nk_dissection)` 
```
