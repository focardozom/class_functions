# Notes for: mutate()
# [`mutate()`] to Add New Columns/Variables $_1$
[[`mutate`](*dataset*, *variable* = *expression*)]
The original data used 1 to mean *yes* and 2 to mean *no*.  
Data should .red[***always***] use 1 to code *yes* and 0 to code *no*. Fix it!  
Binary indicator variables should .red[***always***] start with a verb.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
laryngectomy %>%  # start with everybody with a laryngectomy then     
   select(nk_dissection)  `%>%`  # keep only one variable then  
   `mutate(hadND = 2 - nk_dissection)`  # add a had neck dissection indicator
```
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(lr4ds)
laryngectomy %>%  # start with everybody with a laryngectomy then     
   select(nk_dissection)  %>%  # keep only one variable then  
   mutate(hadND = 2 - nk_dissection ) %>% 
   head(6) # add a had neck dissection indicator
```
