[[`typeof`]`(*dataset$variable*)`]
+ The "type" of an object helps determine what behaviors an object can do.  
  + You can not take the mean of a character variable.
+ These are the typical types that are used in datasets:
.pull-left[
+ int = "integer" for numbers without decimals
+ dbl = "double" for numbers with decimals 
+ lgl = "logical" for true/false
+ date = "date"]
.pull-right[
+ chr = "character" for character string
+ fct = "factor" for categories that are not ordered
+ ord = "ordered" for ordered categories
]  
```{r eval=FALSE}
typeof(pi)
typeof(R.version$nickname)
```
+ Other "types" are used to categorize functions and other complex objects.
+ `R` also uses [`mode()`] to describe type.  It groups "integer" and "double" as "numeric".
