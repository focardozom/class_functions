# Notes for: filter()
# [`dplyr::filter()`]
[[`filter`]`(tableName, logical test)`]
+ Use [`filter()`] to pick rows/records.
+ Inside the [`()`] you put a logic check. 
+ [`filter()`] keeps rows/records where the logic check is true.  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
filter(mtcars, am == 0)  # cars with automatic transmission
filter(mtcars, is.na(mpg))  # cars missing miles per gallon information
filter(mtcars, !is.na(mpg))  # cars not missing miles per gallon information
```
