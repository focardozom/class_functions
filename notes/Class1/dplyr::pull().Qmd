# [`dplyr::pull()`]{.blue}	
	[`pull`]{.blue}`(*dataset*, *variable*)`{.center}
# What it does
	+ The .blue[`pull()`] is used to copy of a variable out of a dataset into a new object.  	
# Demo code
	```{r eval=FALSE}	pull(mtcars, mpg)	```	
# Useful stuff
	+ When it is used with the .blue[`filter()`] function, .blue[`pull()`] can be used to extract a single value from a dataset. This is useful when you need to extract a number,  like an odds ratio or a *p*-value, for a report.	+ .blue[`pull()`] is the only .blue[`dplyr`] function that does not return a `tibble`.	---
