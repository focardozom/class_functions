# Notes for: %>%
# [`%>%`] from the [`magrittr`] Package
[ $thing_1$ [`%>%`]  
 $thing_2$
]
+ The symbol [`%>%`] is called a pipe.  When describing a workflow, it is spoken as "then".
+ It normally sends the output from $thing_1$ to the first argument of $thing_2$.
```{r eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  filter(mpg == 30.4) 
```
+ Many functions can be connected in a pipeline.
+ Start code after a pipe on a new line.
+ Indent all lines of code two spaces after the first pipe.
