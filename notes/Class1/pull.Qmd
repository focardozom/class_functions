# Notes for: pull()
# [`dplyr::pull()`]
[[`pull`]`(*dataset*, *variable*)`]
+ The [`pull()`] is used to copy of a variable out of a dataset into a new object.  
```{r eval=FALSE}
pull(mtcars, mpg)
```
+ When it is used with the [`filter()`] function, [`pull()`] can be used to extract a single value from a dataset. This is useful when you need to extract a number,  like an odds ratio or a *p*-value, for a report.
+ [`pull()`] is the only [`dplyr`] function that does not return a `tibble`.
