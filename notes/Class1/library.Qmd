# Function name: library
# Notes:
# .blue[`library()`]
.center[.blue[`library`]`(*package*)`]
+ The library .blue[`library()`] function loads a package into working memory (from long term storage on your hard disk drive or solid state drive).
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(survial)
```
+ There are a few "meta" packages, like `tidymodels` and `tidyverse`, which load many packages from a single .blue[`library()`] function call.
